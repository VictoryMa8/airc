Big Tech’s Role in Israel’s Genocide
In May of 2025, Microsoft released a statement promising to conduct a review into how the IOF was using their Azure cloud ops technology. They claimed that the participation of an independent firm in this review would make it credible, all in response to mounting pressure that included an article from The Guardian. This article reported that Azure was being used for mass surveillance in both Gaza and the West Bank; Microsoft noted that the “standard terms of service prohibit this type of usage.” 
This month, on the 15th of August, Microsoft updated this statement with the results of the report, which they say found no evidence of a violation of their terms of service. In Electronic Intifada’s weekly report, they interview author Omar Zahzah, who describes how terms of service like the ones referenced by Microsoft are not a useful, ethical way of holding big tech accountable. He praises ongoing protests and direct action by Microsoft employees and the public because, unlike an unthinking company whose only motivation is profit, these independent forces understand that any interaction with the culprit of an ongoing genocide demonstrates complicity.

Campaigners say their protests will continue until the company stops its complicity, and call for a broader movement against big tech’s sponsorship of genocide.
